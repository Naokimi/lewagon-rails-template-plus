# Rails Template+, powered by Le Wagon
A template for Rails 8, intended to help you quickly build apps for production with a set of helpful gems. Inspired heavily by [Le Wagon's Rails Devise template](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates).

For the Rails 7 template please check the `rails-7` branch.
For the Rails 6 template please check the `rails-6` branch.

## Prerequisites:
- [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en)
- A code editor, like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Github CLI](https://cli.github.com/)

## Usage
1. To generate the templates, run the following command:
```
rails new \
  --css=bootstrap \
  -T \
  -m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/naokimi/lewagon-rails-template-plus/master/template.rb \
  CHANGE_THIS_TO_YOUR_RAILS_APP_NAME
```
(Rails 8 has been designed for sqlite3. Rem√©mber to pass `-d <database>` is you want to use a different database.)

Run your generated application with `./bin/dev`
